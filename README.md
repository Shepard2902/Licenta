In this repository i have added the Proteus 8 CAD files and Arduino and Python codes of my bachelor degree's project. The electrical schematic file also contains the PCB and a 3D view of the PCB. The codes are for every module of the system, as it uses an master-slave type of connection between the sensors, one being the master that sends all of the data to the computer, using the python code to see the data in a graphic form, in real time.
